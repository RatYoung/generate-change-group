AquaLush must do the following during an irrigation cycle:- AquaLush must read the working sensor in each zone and place all zones whose sensors are below that zone’s critical moisture level on an active zone list.- AquaLush must count the working valves in the active zones and divide the water allocation by this count to get a valve allocation.- AquaLush must assign each zone a zone allocation, which is the valve allocation multiplied by the number of working valves in the zone.- For each active zone, AquaLush must open all the working valves in the zone.- Every minute, AquaLush must read the zone sensor.- Every minute, AquaLush must compute the zone water usage by multiplying the total ﬂow rate for all open valves in the zone by the time that the valves have been open.- If a zone’s critical moisture level is reached, then AquaLush must close all valves in the zone and go to the next zone.- If a zone’s zone allocation is reached, then AquaLush must close all valves in the zone and go to the next zone.- When all valves in a zone are closed, if the zone allocation is not exhausted, then AquaLush must add the remainder of the zone allocation to the total of the zone allocations of the unirrigated zones, divide this sum by the number of working valves in the unirrigated zones to produce a new valve allocation, and multiply this value by the number of working valves in each unirrigated zone to produce a new zone allocation for each unirrigated zone.- An irrigation cycle must end when every zone on the active zone list has been irrigated.
